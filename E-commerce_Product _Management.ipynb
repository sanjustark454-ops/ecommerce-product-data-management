        "# Introduction\n",
        "Efficient management of product information is essential for the success of e-commerce businesses. This information enables informed decision-making and facilitates effective marketing strategies. File handling plays a key role in being able to manage such data, and Python allows us to handle various file formats which are used to store such data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project, we are going to learn how to load, modify, and save files of three popular file formats which are used in the industry to handle data. These formats are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **CSV**: CSV or comma-separated value files come with the file suffix *.csv* and, as the name suggests, have data values separated by commas. Each data entry is placed on a new line, and typically, the first line tends to store the names of columns. In our dataset, a CSV file is used to store sales values for each product over 14 days.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **JSON**: JSON or JavaScript object notation files come with the file suffix *.json* and store data as key-value pairs, similar to dictionaries in Python. In our dataset, JSON files are used to store details such as product names, prices, and brands.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **TXT**: TXT or text files come with the file suffix *.txt* and generally useful for storing single variables like strings or integers. In our dataset, TXT files are used to store descriptions of products."

        "  - `sales_data`: A dictionary containing sales data, with SKU as keys and a list of sales quantities for the last 14 days as values.\n",
        "  - `product_details`: A dictionary containing product details, with SKU as keys and details as values. Details include attributes like name, brand, model, specifications, price, and availability.\n",
        "  - `product_descriptions`: A dictionary containing product descriptions, with SKU as keys and the textual description of the product as values.\n",
        "  - `main_folder`: A string representing the location of the main folder, which should contain *product_details* and *product_descriptions* subfolders.\n",
        "- The function performs the following operations:\n",
        "  - Dumps the `sales_data` into a CSV file named *sales_data.csv* located in the *main_folder*. Each row in the CSV file represents the sales data for a product, with fields for the SKU and sales quantities for each of the 14 days.\n",
        "  - Dumps each entry in `product_details` into a separate JSON file within the *product_details* subfolder of the *main_folder*. Each file is named after the SKU of the product and contains the details of that product in JSON format.\n",
        "  - Dumps each product description from `product_descriptions` into a separate TXT file within the *product_descriptions* subfolder of the *main_folder*. Each file is named after the SKU of the product and contains the textual description of that product.\n",
        "- Prior to dumping product details and descriptions, the function checks if the respective subfolders exist. If not, it creates them.\n",
        "- Usage:\n",
        "  - The function is designed to persist the current state of sales data, product details, and product descriptions to the filesystem, allowing for data backup and recovery. It organizes the persisted data into a structured directory and file system based on the specified *main_folder* path.\n"
